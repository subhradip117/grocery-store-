The Happy Basket is a Python Tkinter-based grocery app where customers can browse categories, add items to the cart, verify with OTP, and simulate payment. It uses Tkinter, PIL, qrcode, and random modules. Currently for customers only, without database, QR login, or cashier interfaceâ€”future updates will add these features.
